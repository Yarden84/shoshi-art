  "content": "Hi, I’m Shoshi Haizler, a painter, sculptor, and linguistic editor. I find joy in exploring the beauty of form, color, and language, and I divide my time between Israel and Copenhagen, two places that continually inspire my creative work.\n\n\n\nWhen I’m not in the studio with a brush or working with my hands in sculpture, I’m immersed in the world of words, carefully shaping texts as a linguistic editor. Both art and language are, for me, ways to express subtle emotions and human stories.\n\n\n\nI’m also a proud mother of two wonderful children and a grandmother to five amazing grandchildren, who fill my life with inspiration, curiosity, and warmth.\n\n\n\nThrough my art, I aim to share moments of reflection, movement, and connection.\n\nThank you for being here.",
